The `.sink` subscriber (Subscribers.Sink) is sort of an all-purpose subscriber. In its fullest form, it is created with this method:

    func sink(receiveCompletion: f1, receiveValue: f2) -> AnyCancellable

(I'll deal [later](AnyCancellable) with the significance of the fact that the `sink` method produces an object typed as AnyCancellable rather than Subscribers.Sink.)

In my notation, `f1` and `f2` are functions. They will usually be anonymous functions, and the second function will usually be written using trailing closure syntax, so the `receiveValue` label will be omitted. A typical call will therefore look more or less like this:

~~~
.sink(receiveCompletion: {
    comp in // ...
}) {
    val in // ...
}
~~~

In the first function, the incoming parameter is a _completion_. This, as I explained [earlier](startCompletions), is actually a Subscribers.Completion enum specifying the completion message. There are two possible cases:

* `.finished` — The publisher is telling us that there will be no more values forthcoming because it has finished producing values <%= xref("SECcompletion", "in good order") %>. For example, a data task publisher sends a `.finished` completion after it has done whatever networking we asked it to do.

* `.failure` — The publisher is telling us that there will be no more values forthcoming because it has encountered an 
<%= xref("SECfailuremessage", "unrecoverable failure") %>. 
The nature of that failure is expressed as an Error object which is this enum case's associated value.

In the second function, the incoming parameter is an actual value that came down the pipeline.

Here's a minimal `.sink` implementation that acknowledges all possible outcomes:

~~~
.sink(receiveCompletion: {
    switch $0 {
        case .finished: print("finished in good order")
        case let .failure(err): print("failure!", err)
    }
}) { print($0) }
~~~

If the failure type of the publisher just upstream of the sink is Never, meaning that no failure can occur, it is permitted to omit the `receiveCompletion` parameter entirely. You don't _have_ to omit it; but if you have no use for a `.finished` completion, you might prefer to do so. In that case, we can rewrite our `.sink` implementation more simply:

~~~
.sink() { print($0) }
~~~

The salient feature of `.sink` is that you can do anything you want in its functions, especially the `receiveValue` function. A value has arrived at the end of the pipeline; what would you like to do with it? A `.sink` subscriber is the most flexible way to answer that question by responding to the arrival of a value.
