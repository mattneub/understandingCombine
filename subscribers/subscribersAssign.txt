#title "Assign"

# <%= title %>

The `.assign` subscriber (Subscribers.Assign) is legal only with a publisher whose error type is Never (because it has no means of coping with a failure message):

    func assign(to:on:) -> AnyCancellable

(I'll deal [later](AnyCancellable) with the significance of the fact that the `assign` method produces an object typed as AnyCancellable rather than Subscribers.Assign.)

The first parameter is a property, designated as a Swift keypath; the second parameter is an object. The outcome is that the incoming value will be assigned to that property of that object.

The example I gave [earlier](startFailures) was of a UIImage coming down the pipeline and being assigned to an image view's `image` property:

~~~
.assign(to: \.image, on: self.iv)
~~~

It isn't clear to me that the `.assign` subscriber does anything you couldn't do with the `.sink` subscriber; after all, you could assign the image to an image view's `image` property in the `.sink` function:

~~~
.sink { self.iv.image = $0 }
~~~

However, `.assign` is a nice way of expressing the common case where the purpose of the pipeline is to use the value to set a property of some object.

On the other side of the coin, `.assign` can dangerous: you can end up with a retain cycle. This occurs in the common situation where what you're assigning to is a property of `self`. The example I've used [repeatedly](startFailures) is _not_ a case in point:

~~~
URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
    .map {$0.data}
    .replaceError(with: Data())
    .compactMap { UIImage(data:$0) }
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .assign(to: \.image, on: self.iv)
    .store(in:&self.storage)
~~~

In the first place, `self.iv` is not `self`. In the second place, a data task publisher either sends a failure or it delivers one value followed by a completion, so that either way, the entire pipeline is released in good order almost immediately. The problem arises, as far as I can tell, when the property _is_ a property of `self` _and_ the pipeline is never cancelled from upstream.

The workaround is to use `.sink` instead of `.assign`, because you can use the capture list to specify that `self` is `weak` or `unowned`, breaking the cycle. So, assuming that `image` is a property of `self`, this might cause a retain cycle, depending on the behavior of the upstream publisher:

~~~
.assign(to: \.image, on: self)
~~~

If so, replace it with this:

~~~
.sink { [unowned self] in self.image = $0 }
~~~

The `unowned self` breaks the retain cycle, and `self` is able to go out of existence in the normal way.
